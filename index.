## The Life of _J.R.R Tolkien_

When given this assignment I decided to build this in VSCode rather than use the Codepen application, as I thought I needed to prepare and aquatint myself with the workings of VSCode. I chose author JRR Tolkien as his work gave me a love of reading, film, media and imagination.
Tolkien led a fascinating life which I believe not many people are aware, so I dedicated this tribute page to him so others may learn.

### His Main Works...
1. _The Hobbit_
2. _The Lord of the Rings_
3. _The Silmarrillion_

Thank you for the opportunity to join _School of Code_, I cannot wait to get started!!!
